/// Builder for the i.MX RT runtime.
///
/// `RuntimeBuilder` let you assign sections to memory regions. It also lets
/// you partition FlexRAM DTCM/ITCM/OCRAM. Call [`build()`](RuntimeBuilder::build) to commit the
/// runtime configuration.
///
/// # Behaviors
///
/// The implementation tries to place the stack in the lowest-possible memory addresses.
/// This means the stack will grow down into reserved memory below DTCM and OCRAM for most
/// chip families. The outlier is the 1170, where the stack will grow into OCRAM backdoor for
/// the CM4 coprocessor. Be careful here...
///
/// Similarly, the implementation tries to place the heap in the highest-possible memory
/// addresses. This means the heap will grow up into reserved memory above DTCM and OCRAM
/// for most chip families.
///
/// The vector table requires a 1024-byte alignment. The vector table's placement is prioritized
/// above all other sections, except the stack. If placing the stack and vector table in the
/// same section (which is the default behavior), consider keeping the stack size as a multiple
/// of 1 KiB to minimize internal fragmentation.
///
/// # Default values
///
/// The example below demonstrates the default `RuntimeBuilder` memory placements,
/// stack sizes, and heap sizes.
///
/// ```
/// use imxrt_rt::{Family, RuntimeBuilder, Memory};
///
/// const FLASH_SIZE: usize = 16 * 1024;
/// let family = Family::Imxrt1060;
///
/// let mut b = RuntimeBuilder::from_flexspi(family, FLASH_SIZE);
/// // FlexRAM banks represent default fuse values.
/// b.flexram_banks(family.default_flexram_banks());
/// b.text(Memory::Itcm);    // Copied from flash.
/// b.rodata(Memory::Ocram); // Copied from flash.
/// b.data(Memory::Ocram);   // Copied from flash.
/// b.vectors(Memory::Dtcm); // Copied from flash.
/// b.bss(Memory::Ocram);
/// b.uninit(Memory::Ocram);
/// b.stack(Memory::Dtcm);
/// b.stack_size(8 * 1024);  // 8 KiB stack.
/// b.heap(Memory::Dtcm);    // Heap in DTCM...
/// b.heap_size(0);          // ...but no space given to the heap.
///
/// assert_eq!(b, RuntimeBuilder::from_flexspi(family, FLASH_SIZE));
/// ```
///
/// # Environment overrides
///
/// Certain memory regions, like the stack and heap, can be sized using environment
/// variables. As the provider of the runtime, you can use `*_env_override` methods
/// to select the environment variable(s) that others may use to set the size, in bytes,
/// for these memory regions.
///
/// The rest of this section describes how environment variables interact with other
/// methods on this builder. Although the examples use stack size, the concepts apply
/// to all regions that can be sized with environment variables.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use imxrt_rt::{Family, RuntimeBuilder, Memory};
/// # const FLASH_SIZE: usize = 16 * 1024;
/// # let family = Family::Imxrt1060;
/// RuntimeBuilder::from_flexspi(family, FLASH_SIZE)
///     .stack_size_env_override("YOUR_STACK_SIZE")
///     // ...
///     # .build().unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// In the above example, if a user set an environment variable `YOUR_STACK_SIZE=1024`, then
/// the runtime's stack size is 1024. Otherwise, the stack size is the default stack size.
///
/// > As a convenience, a user can use a `k` or `K` suffix to specify multiples of 1024 bytes.
/// > For example, the environment variables `YOUR_STACK_SIZE=4k` and `YOUR_STACK_SIZE=4K` are
/// > each equivalent to `YOUR_STACK_SIZE=4096`.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use imxrt_rt::{Family, RuntimeBuilder, Memory};
/// # const FLASH_SIZE: usize = 16 * 1024;
/// # let family = Family::Imxrt1060;
/// RuntimeBuilder::from_flexspi(family, FLASH_SIZE)
///     .stack_size_env_override("YOUR_STACK_SIZE")
///     .stack_size(2048)
///     // ...
///     # .build().unwrap();
///
/// RuntimeBuilder::from_flexspi(family, FLASH_SIZE)
///     .stack_size(2048)
///     .stack_size_env_override("YOUR_STACK_SIZE")
///     // ...
///     # .build().unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// In the above example, the two builders produce the same runtime. The builder
/// selects the stack size from the environment variable, if available. Otherwise,
/// the stack size is 2048 bytes. The call order is irrelevant, since the builder
/// doesn't consult the environment until you invoke [`build()`](Self::build).
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use imxrt_rt::{Family, RuntimeBuilder, Memory};
/// # const FLASH_SIZE: usize = 16 * 1024;
/// # let family = Family::Imxrt1060;
/// RuntimeBuilder::from_flexspi(family, FLASH_SIZE)
///     .stack_size_env_override("INVALIDATED")
///     .stack_size_env_override("YOUR_STACK_SIZE")
///     // ...
///     # .build().unwrap();
/// ````
///
/// In the above example, `YOUR_STACK_SIZE` invalidates the call with `INVALIDATED`.
/// Therefore, `YOUR_STACK_SIZE` controls the stack size, if set. Otherwise, the stack
/// size is the default stack size.
